# Frontless - don't use React and Javascript, when you can use Swift :-) 

TokamakBoostrap is set of components to build web applications in Swift/SwiftUI - running natively in the browser via webassembly.
It's built on top of https://github.com/TokamakUI/Tokamak, but differs in set of goals:

* It's for Swift developers who want to build rich, interactive, Web, (CRUD?) applications
* It has non - SwiftUI compatible additions, such as Table, Menu, built on Bootstrap CSS framework
* It allows writing Single Page Apps (navigation, href links etc)
