# Frontless 


_Don't use Javascript, React, Npm, Gulp, Grunt, Webpack, when you can simply use Swift! :-)_

Frontless is the set of components for building web applications in Swift/SwiftUI - running natively in the browser via Web Assembly.
It's built on top of https://github.com/TokamakUI/Tokamak, but differs in goals:

* It's more web friendly - it uses Bootstrap CSS, has native href links, and forward/back navigation
* It's suitable for building bigger desktop web-apps, such as CRUD web apps
* It has SwiftUI look and feel, but its components are specifically designed for the web, such as Table, Menu, Filters
